This document aims to illustrate the process of interpreting and validating clustering results using the K-Means algorithm. Clustering, an unsupervised learning technique, groups similar data points into clusters, and assessing the quality of these clusters is crucial to ensure they represent meaningful patterns. The example leverages the Iris dataset, a well-known, simple, and small dataset, to facilitate visualization and interpretation.

The process begins with importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by data standardization. The elbow method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring an effective clustering configuration. K-Means clustering is then applied, and the results are interpreted using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for visualization.

To validate the clustering results, various metrics are used, including the comparison with known labels to assess the clustering accuracy. This comprehensive approach demonstrates how to effectively interpret and validate clustering outcomes, providing insights into the patterns within the data.
